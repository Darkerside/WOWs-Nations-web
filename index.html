						<h2>Ships of USA</h2>
						<img alt="Wows_flag_USA.png" src="assets/image/flag/Wows_flag_USA.png" width="92" height="65" />
						<p>Ships fielded by the United States Navy (USN) sport great armor (albeit in an all-or-nothing design), main battery guns, and anti-aircraft (AA) capabilities, and are less hindered by stock configurations — many were built later and subsequently underwent fewer, less drastic upgrades (unlike Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) vessels such as <i>Kongo</i>). Most stock American ships are adequate for their roles, and while fully-upgraded ships perform better, they require little to no change in play style. American ship-launched torpedoes are often comically bad, but the real strength of USN ships lies in their ability to get into firefights and slug it out, relying on their superior guns and survivability to see them through.</p>
						<p>The United States inherited many of its nascent naval traditions from the British, from whom they won their independence in 1776. Over the years, the fledgling American navy encountered various hurdles and successes in its conflicts with the British, French, and Spanish navies. However, a mix of poor economic outlook, isolationist sentiments and post-World War I naval disarmament treaties reduced the effectiveness and preparedness of the USN for the Second World War. All of that changed after Japan's 7 December 1941 surprise attack on Pacific Fleet headquarters at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Regarded as an underhanded sneak attack outside the rules of civilized warfare, Pearl Harbor evaporated any reluctance of the American public to go to war.</p>
						<p>With its battleship fleet crippled by the Pearl Harbor attack, the USN turned to submarines and its fledgling aircraft carrier fleet — the very weapons that the IJN had used in their attempt to neutralize the USN Pacific Fleet — and ironically put them to greater effect than the Japanese (who stuck to battleships and the "decisive battle" doctrines), achieving successes in the battles of the Coral Sea, Midway, the Philippine Sea, Leyte Gulf, and Okinawa. While slightly behind their IJN counterparts at the onset of the war, the USN gradually caught up both qualitatively and quantitatively; virtually every class of vessel was outfitted with superior fire control equipment such as radar and ballistics computers; the industrial might of the United States produced large numbers of proven designs (the 175 ships of the <i>Fletcher</i> class built within the space of less than four years being a prime example) with little unnecessary variation in equipment, so that crew transferred between ships could quickly fill their roles without specialized retraining. The US Navy emerged from World War II as the most powerful navy in the world, a title it still holds to this day.</p>

						<h2>Ships of JAPAN</h2>
						<img alt="Wows_flag_Japan.png" src="assets/image/flag/Wows_flag_Japan.png" width="92" height="65" />
						<p>As an island nation, the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) was consistently the forefront of Japan's military, characterized by advanced development of naval technology, quality shipbuilding and superb seamanship. Japan also readily looked to and accepted foreign input after the opening of their borders, from the rapid assimilation of foreign technology, to the frequent military exchanges with Dutch, French, British and United States navies, with plenty of naval students being sent to their naval academies and many ships (such as the <i>Kongo</i>) initially being purchased or built in their dockyards while Japan perfected her own shipbuilding capabilities. At the onset of World War II, the IJN was among the few navies who had properly adopted naval aviation and the only navy with fully developed torpedo assets, achieving stunning victories and technological innovations — sweeping successes in the Russo-Japanese and First Sino-Japanese Wars, the Battle of Tsushima, the sinkings of HMS Prince of Wales and HMS Repulse, the world's first purpose-built aircraft carrier, the deadly Type 93 "Long Lance" torpedo — and laying down classes of cruisers and destroyers that, despite being much older than their adversaries, remained among the most powerful of their class of any nation during the War.</p>
						<p>However, several mistakes and oversights during the war resulted in their near-annihilation by the United States Navy. Design flaws — typically the results of cramming as much weaponry as possible into a limited displacement — caused certain ships to be top-heavy and unstable. While concentrating air assets into a single, cohesive force was as effective as it was revolutionary, their carriers were inadequately protected from counterattacks due to lack of radar, faulty design and configuration of anti-aircraft guns, as well as ineffective fire control systems. The surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii of 7 December 1941 was a tactical victory but a strategic error, bringing into the war a nation that — while initially under-prepared and as yet unwilling to go to war — had near-limitless resources and unmatched production capabilities. Compounding the error, little to none of the support facilities based in Pearl Harbor — naval repair yards, fuel depots, logistics infrastructure — were attacked, allowing the United States to quickly recover and strike back with a vengeance from their primary naval base in the Pacific. In contrast, Japan did not have the capabilities to replace their losses as quickly, were incredibly dependent on imports — indeed, reducing that dependency was actually one of the major reasons for Japan's expansionist desires — and their unprotected shipping lines due to under-investment in anti-submarine and anti-aircraft warfare allowed the United States Navy to slowly starve Japan into submission.</p>
						<p>Japanese ships tend to have great variations in design; each class encountered is likely to have noticeably different handling characteristics from the previous tier, a result of the IJN constantly experimenting with or influenced by different designs and doctrines. They boast consistently superior torpedoes, accurate and long-range guns with high alpha damage, and outstanding concealment and mobility; however, they suffer from inferior survivability and anti-aircraft defenses. Their play style is very similar to the "decisive battle" doctrine that dominated IJN tactics: strike fast and strike hard with precision at targets of importance and/or opportunity, but every hit taken in exchange will be painfully felt.</p>

						<h2>Ships of U.S.S.R.</h2>
						<img alt="Wows_flag_Russian_Empire_and_USSR.png" src="assets/image/flag/Wows_flag_Russian_Empire_and_USSR.png" width="92" height="65" />
						<p>With over half her massive landmass bordered by water, Russia's navy was (and still is today) divided into four major fleets: the Pacific, Northern, Baltic and Black Sea Fleets; at the height of the Russian Empire, the Imperial Russian Navy was the fourth most powerful fleet in the world after Great Britain, Spain and France. Lagging technological advancement and disastrous wars greatly dented her power, resulting in mixed performance in World War I; the Northern Fleet was created during the War to protect shipping in the Barents Sea, the Baltic Fleet played a largely defensive role, the Black Sea Fleet distinguished herself against the Ottoman Navy and the Pacific Fleet had faded into insignificance following the Russo-Japanese War and the Battle of Tsushima in 1905. The Imperial Russian Navy suffered a near-complete collapse in the Russian Revolution and the resulting Civil War during the closing years of World War I, and was eventually succeeded by the Soviet Union's Red Fleet.</p>
						<p>In the years between the World Wars, the rapidly-industrializing Soviet Union (or U.S.S.R.) planned to rebuild the navy, but the Great Purge prevented any meaningful progress, and the Red Fleet would only have a handful of cruisers, obsolete battleships and a reasonable number of destroyers when the U.S.S.R. entered World War II in June 1942 with Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union, <i>Operation Barbarossa</i>. However, this did not stop the Red Fleet from performing with distinction: the Baltic Fleet used its sizable submarine fleet to great effect against the Kriegsmarine and the Finnish Navy despite suffering terrible losses themselves; the Naval Aviation service, while not having a single aircraft carrier, sank more ships and crew than any other unit; Russian resourcefulness and tenacity was exemplified by naval guns still being put to use even after extensive damage to individual ships (such as battleship <i>Marat</i>). Thousands of sailors and naval equipment were drafted to reinforce the Red Army as needed, fighting with incredible valor in many significant engagements, including the Battles of Odessa, Sevastopol, Stalingrad, Novorossiysk, and Leningrad. After World War II, the Red Fleet was renamed the Soviet Navy, and went on to play a major role in the Cold War with the United States.</p>

						<h2>Ships of Germany</h2>
						<img alt="Wows_flag_Germany.png" src="assets/image/flag/Wows_flag_Germany.png" width="92" height="65" />
						<p>Throughout most of European history, Germany's naval prowess had always been eclipsed by its British, French, Dutch and Spanish neighbors. A unified Germany only came into being in the late 19th century, thus it did not play a major role in the European colonial period; while its inherited coastline (largely from the Kingdom of Prussia) was relatively long, Germany's geographical location at the center of the European continent meant that greater preference was given to its army and its navy never went beyond being a coastal defense force. Beginning in the late 19th century, Kaiser Wilhelm II pursued a policy of naval strengthening, believing that a powerful navy was the key to power on the world stage and possibly also wishing to compete with his cousin, King George V of Britain. While the meteoric rise of the Imperial German Navy caught the attention of Europe and brought about a costly naval arms race, it was never able to out-build and out-innovate the Royal Navy, who responded with powerful and revolutionary designs such as HMS <i>Dreadnought</i> and the <i>Queen Elizabeth</i>-class battleships. Nevertheless, the Imperial German Navy was a formidable force in World War I, being the first navy in the world to display the crippling effectiveness of submarines (despite technological limitations) against unescorted merchant shipping and slow, sluggish warships.</p>
						<p>After her defeat, Germany once again set about attempting to challenge the Royal Navy with "Plan Z", but the earlier-than-expected outbreak of World War II meant that it could not be fully implemented, leaving her navy — now known as the Kriegsmarine — severely under-equipped to go toe-to-toe with the Royal Navy. This caused her surface fleet to be mostly relegated to operations support (such as <i>Operation Weserübung</i>, the invasion of Norway and Denmark) and commerce raiding. However, the Kriegsmarine had powerful (but very few) battleships and battlecruisers, scoring victories in sinking HMS <i>Hood</i> and HMS <i>Glorious</i> and putting up valiant, stubborn resistance — a testament to the crews' tenacity — until the superior numbers of British forces wore them down. As in World War I, more feared than her surface combatants were her fleet of U-boats; the largest, most powerful in the world and under the command of Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz — an experienced submariner himself who was instrumental in the buildup of the U-boat fleet after the scrapping of "Plan Z" — they wreaked havoc on British and American fleets and supply lines, sinking 14 million tons of shipping and more enemy warships than any other class throughout the war. Eventually, mounting losses inflicted by the Royal Navy resulted in the Kriegsmarine's surrender along with Germany on 8 May 1945, Victory in Europe (V-E) Day.</p>

						<h2>Ships of U.K.</h2>
						<img alt="Wows_flag_UK.png" src="assets/image/flag/Wows_flag_UK.png" width="92" height="65" />
						<p>From the early 18th century until the middle of the 20th century, the Royal Navy of the United Kingdom was the most powerful in the world, defeating the French, Dutch and Spanish navies to establish the British Empire as the dominant world power — the "empire on which the sun never sets" — influencing many aspects of life in numerous countries across the world, even today. Due to this historical prominence, although many other navies have similar designations, only the United Kingdom's is referred to as "The Royal Navy" without further qualification. The Royal Navy pioneered many advances in naval technology and strategy: the construction of HMS <i>Dreadnought</i>, whose revolutionary design so shocked the world that battleships for a time became generically labelled as "dreadnought" or "pre-dreadnought"; the first battlecruisers; the world's first carrier-launched, all-aircraft attack at the Battle of Taranto; anti-submarine warfare advancements such as sonar, high-frequency direction finding, hydrophones, depth charges, and the "Hedgehog" anti-submarine mortar; and innovations to aircraft carrier designs such as concentrating the bridge and flight control tower into one island superstructure (as opposed to a <i>flush deck</i> configuration), steam catapults and ski-jump ramps for launching aircraft, and full-length, armored, and angled flight decks.</p>
						<p>Up to and during the First World War, the Germans attempted to challenge the might of the Royal Navy, only to be blockaded and stymied by the latter's superior tactics (drawn from centuries of experience) and numbers; however, the effectiveness of Germany's U-boats on unescorted shipping taught the British important lessons in convoy tactics - a lesson which the Americans would soon learn upon their entry into the Second World War. Although World War I severely depleted the British and consequently the Royal Navy, it was still a formidable force, and after the London and Washington Naval Treaties were no longer being observed by the other nations in 1938, it set about rapidly re-arming itself to reaffirm its place as the most powerful navy in the world. This did not come by easily however, as it suffered heavy losses in the opening stages of World War II with the sinking of HMS <i>Courageous</i>, HMS <i>Glorious</i>, and HMS <i>Hood</i> in the Atlantic, and HMS <i>Hermes</i>, HMS <i>Repulse</i> and HMS <i>Prince of Wales</i> in the Pacific. Nevertheless, the Royal Navy's resilience won through, playing a major part in Operations Dynamo, Husky, Torch, Avalanche, and Overlord; the guarding of supply lines that enabled the British and her allies to fight in all theaters of the War; the British Pacific Fleet distinguished herself in every engagement she was involved in, despite facing various logistical and political difficulties; the systematic cornering and sinking of the Kriegsmarine's powerful battleships and battlecruisers; the seizing of many Enigma-related codebooks and machines; and the near-annihilation of the U-boat fleet in the Battle of the Atlantic. Both World Wars greatly taxed the British Empire, and her decline led to the Royal Navy handing the reins over to the US Navy as the most powerful navy in the world.</p>

						<h2>Ships of Commonwealth</h2>
						<img alt="Wows_flag_Commonwealth.png" src="assets/image/flag/Wows_flag_Commonwealth.png" width="92" height="65"/>
						<p>The "Commonwealth of Nations" was born in the early twentieth century during the waning years of the British Empire. Officially formed in December 1931 via the Statute of Westminster, the original seven member states were the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, Ireland, and Newfoundland. Today, it is made up of 52 sovereign states that span the globe, and currently includes nations that had no previous political or economic ties to the United Kingdom or the British Empire.</p>
						<p>Several of the various nation-states that comprise the Commonwealth deploy their own military forces. Collectively, they are represented in World of Warships under a single flag, but each navy has its own history and traditions.</p><hr/>

						</div>
						<p>At the beginning of the twentieth century, the British Empire faced a unique dilemma: the challenge of protecting its many dominions across the world. In the case of the Dominion of Canada, there were two easy solutions: either provide the Royal Navy the resources to protects borders of the Dominion, or take the necessary steps to allow Canada to provide for her own defense. The latter path was chosen, and soon the government put forth a Naval Service Bill organizing a permanent and volunteer force, as well founding as a naval college to train future personnel. Thus, in 1910 the Naval Service of Canada was born; it was later designated the <b>Royal Canadian Navy (RCN)</b> by King George V on 29 August 1911.</p>
						<p>The nucleus of the nascent navy came in the shape of two cruisers: HMCS <i>Rainbow</i> and HMCS <i>Niobe</i>, both seeing service primarily as training vessels. Despite government contention on the logistics and practicality of fielding a navy, the citizens of Canada were supportive of the institution and bolstered the manpower of the volunteer reserve forces (RNCVR).</p>
						<p>By the start of the First World War, the RCN had grown to four cruisers and two submarines. This rather small force spent the majority of the conflict patrolling both coastlines of North America, with most of these assets being deemed unfit for service before the war’s end. The lack of growth of the Navy was largely attributed to the decision by the Canadian government to allow citizens to choose whether they wished to serve with the Royal Canadian Navy or the British equivalent; many chose to serve in the latter.</p>
						<p>The end of World War I saw a reduction of manpower plus a transition to conducting civilian duties, with its handful of destroyers and single cruiser. On the other hand, enthusiasm in the RNCVR stayed strong and continued to grow through the interwar years. By the 1930's, the RCN was slowly seeing new life breathed into it via the acquisition of two new destroyers built in England – the first ships purpose-built for the RCN. Further investment in the service was spurred on by rising tensions and aggression in Europe and Asia; more destroyers and training vessels were acquired.</p>
						<p>The events of the Second World War saw an explosion of growth for the Royal Canadian Navy; ships were simultaneously produced at home and acquired from abroad, with new recruits drawing in from all across the country. The Navy primarily operated in the North Atlantic and was solely responsible for the oversight of the entire Northwest Theater of operations. The RCN fulfilled two primary functions: convoy protection and submarine hunting. During six years of active combat duty, the RCN proved its potential through the destruction or capture of twenty-seven (27) German submarines and forty-two (42) Axis ships. Even more impressive was the fact that the Navy successfully escorted over 25,000 convoy crossings, delivery nearly 182,000,000 tons worth of men and materials critical for the war effort from North America to the United Kingdom. Tragically, this did come at the cost of twenty-four (24) vessels and nearly 2,000 personnel.</p>
						<p>By the end of World War II, the RCN had transformed from an inexperienced service to a formidable force; it was the third-largest navy in the entire world, despite consisting predominantly of destroyers. None could question the diligence displayed by the personnel of the RCN; years of submarine hunting had shaped the service into masters of anti-submarine warfare. That experience would come in handy during the Cold War while tracking the Soviet submarines. To this day, the proud traditions of the RCN adhere to the prestige forged by their founders and predecessors.</p><hr/>

						<p>With the vast majority of its population spread along the long coastlines of the country, Australia relied upon detached units from the Royal Navy to provide naval defense for more than a century. This arrangement remained the status quo until 1909, when talks began of a dedicated naval unit to be deployed to Australian waters. It was decided between the British Admiralty and the Australian Government that Australia would purchase a "fleet unit" consisting of six destroyers, three cruisers, three submarines, various auxiliaries, and a battlecruiser. The first two ships, HMAS <i>Yarra</i> and HMAS <i>Parramatta</i>, reached Australian waters in November 1910, and on 10 July 1911 King George V granted the title of <b>Royal Australian Navy (RAN)</b> to the Commonwealth Naval Forces. By 1913, the completed Australian fleet — led by battlecruiser HMAS <i>Australia</i> — entered Sydney Harbour for the first time.</p>
						<p>The RAN served on the frontlines of World War I, supporting Australian landings in the invasion of the German New Guinea colonies and attacking the Ottoman Navy in the Sea of Marmora during the Gallipoli campaign. HMAS <i>Sydney</i> faced off alone against SMS <i>Emden</i> in the middle of the Indian Ocean and won — earning the RAN's first victory at sea — while HMAS <i>Australia</i> was later involved in the Battle of Jutland. After the war, the RAN — like most other navies around the world — was forced to make changes as a result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. They had to scrap their only battlecruiser as a result of the treaty, but gained several pre-war submarines and destroyers.</p>
						<p>During the inter-war period, older ships were sold for scrap while newer heavy cruisers, light cruisers, submarines, destroyers, and a seaplane carrier found their way into RAN service. Hampered by the inter-war disarmament policies due to shifting economic and political situations, the RAN rose once again to fight in World War II. Throughout 1940, the RAN distinguished itself in the Mediterranean with the famous destroyers of the "Scrap Iron Flotilla". RAN units returned to defend the Australian homeland when war broke out in the Pacific and enemy ships prowled Australian waters, fighting against the encroaching Empire of Japan as close to home as the Coral Sea.</p>
						<p>Since the end of the Second World War, the Royal Australian Navy has served in operations from the Korean Theater to East Timor, focusing on protecting Australia’s interests in the southwestern Pacific region and peacekeeping around the globe with a 50-strong fleet of modern destroyers, frigates, submarines, and auxiliaries.</p><hr/>

							<img alt="Wows_flag_New_Zealand.png" src="assets/image/flag/Wows_flag_New_Zealand.png" width="68" height="46"/>
						</div>
						<p>Much like their neighbors across the Tasman Sea, New Zealand was protected by the Royal Navy from its founding well into the twentieth century. The residents of New Zealand took an active role in contributing to their own defense early on, providing spar torpedo boats to their assigned division of the Royal Navy late in the nineteenth century as well as fully funding the <i>Indefatigable</i>-class battlecruiser HMS <i>New Zealand</i> commissioned into His Majesty's service in 1911. <i>New Zealand</i> served throughout the duration of World War I, seeing action at Heligoland Blight, Dogger Bank, and in the Battle of Jutland.</p>
						<p>The "New Zealand Naval Forces" were formally organized as a part of the Naval Defence Act of 1913, and referred to as the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy from 1921 onwards. The New Zealand Division was largely comprised of cruisers and lighter units, including HMS <i>Leander</i>, HMS <i>Achilles</i>, and a pair of Danae-class cruisers. With the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, New Zealand joined the rest of the British Empire in declaring war on Germany. Recognizing that the existing New Zealand Division was already largely independent and self-sufficient, King George VI christened it the <b>Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN)</b> on 1 October 1941. The RNZN contributed ships and men in several key theaters of operations during the course of the war, seeing action — and suffering losses — in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans as well as the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
						<p>Having grown to nearly sixty ships by August 1945, the RNZN was drastically scaled down in size following the conclusion of the Second World War. Nevertheless, RNZN forces continued to participate in combat operations in conjunction with the United Nations by contributing ships to both the Korean War and intervention efforts in East Timor. The modern RNZN has fewer than a dozen ships in service: a mix of frigates, coastal patrol vessels, and other light craft that patrol home waters and ensure the sovereignty and safety of their homeland.</p>

						<h2>Ships of France</h2>
						<img alt="Wows_flag_France.png" src="assets/image/flag/Wows_flag_France.png" width="92" height="65" />
						<p>"Honor, Homeland, Valor, Discipline." These are still the four tenets that define the <i>Marine Nationale</i> — or "La Royale" — as one of the world's oldest navies. The <i>Marine Nationale</i> was instrumental in establishing the French colonial empire and engaging in near-constant conflicts with their European neighbors, particularly the Royal Navy. Despite constantly being dwarfed in overall size by their closest rival, the well-funded and well-equipped <i>Marine Nationale</i> still had an outsized influence on world events and naval strategy, being deeply involved in the American Revolutionary War in the 18th century, the modernizing efforts of the Imperial Japanese Navy in the 19th century, negotiating the various post-World War I naval treaties early in the 20th century, and developing the <i>Jeune École</i> naval theory. Its engineers and shipbuilders were among the best in the world, building the <i>Le Fantasque</i> class of destroyers — the world's fastest to this day — and while the French paid little heed to naval aviation, their focus on battleships, especially fast battleships, produced the <i>Dunkerque</i> and <i>Richelieu</i> classes, regarded as among the most successful designs built under the displacement limits of the Washington Naval Treaty.</p>
						<p>Largely spared from the deep military budget cuts brought about by the Treaty of Versailles during the interwar period, the <i>Marine Nationale</i> took part in the Battle of the Atlantic, Operation Weserübung, and Operation Dynamo at the onset of the Second World War. However, the signing of the Armistice of 22 June 1940 with Germany meant that all operations with the Allies had to be suspended under the new Vichy France client state, with the exception of those who were able to join the Free French Naval Forces. While the terms of the Armistice meant that France was officially neutral, the British did not want to risk having the most powerful vessels of the <i>Marine Nationale</i> fall into enemy hands. Thus, the Royal Navy was directed to execute Operation Catapult, an attack on the French naval forces docked at Mers-el-Kébir, Algeria, on 3 July 1940, greatly souring relations between the two powers for years to come. Nevertheless, rather than allow them to be captured by the Germans as part of Case Anton, French sailors scuttled the remainder of their fleet in Toulon on 27 November 1942, retaining their honor till the very end.</p>

						<h2>Ships of Italy</h2>

						<p>With the fall of the Roman Empire in 476 AD, the Italian peninsula would not be united for over a thousand years until the proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861. Out of this unification was born the Italian Royal Navy, known as the <i>Regia Marina</i>. Situated in the very center of the Mediterranean, the newly established <i>Regia Marina</i> attempted to claim the Mediterranean Sea as <i>Mare Nostrum</i> (literally "Our Sea"), constantly vying for supremacy against France, England, and Austria-Hungary, keeping the <i>Regia Marina</i> at the forefront of Italian politics. Unfortunately, they were hampered from the very beginning by a serious lack of cohesion and uniformity in their officers and equipment, pitiful naval budgets resulting in poor infrastructure and facilities with which to support the navy, and rapidly advancing technologies that the divided naval schools of Italy couldn’t keep up with. The navies of Austria-Hungary and Italy eventually spent most of World War I keeping each other at bay in their respective harbors, with the notable exceptions of the latter's MAS motorboats (<i>mezzi d'assalto</i>, or torpedo armed motorboats) and the first working prototypes of miniature single-torpedo armed submarines — dubbed "human torpedoes" — employed to sink two Austro-Hungarian battleships late in the War.</p>
						<p>During the interwar period, the <i>Regia Marina</i> was once again pressured by the changing global political situation to choose a proper design doctrine for their warships. Concluding that the French would be their most likely adversaries, they emphasized speed and long-range gunnery, and set about modernizing their older World War I dreadnoughts, building the <i>Littorio-class</i> battleships and a wide variety of destroyers, submarines and cruisers, including the <i>Zara</i>-class: the best-protected heavy cruisers ever built until they were surpassed almost 20 years later by the U.S. Navy's <i>Des Moines</i> class. Entering World War II with the fourth largest navy in the world, the <i>Regia Marina</i> nevertheless struggled against the French and British navies for dominance over the Mediterranean. While having long gun ranges and excellent fire control systems, a near total disregard for radar and sonar technology consigned the <i>Regia Marina</i> to a “fair weather fleet”, relying on visual sighting of targets and making overcast days and night battles incredibly disadvantageous. Greatly aware of their inability to replace losses, naval commanders were forced to confer with headquarters for virtually any engagement, wasting precious time and failing to press even the clearest of decisive advantages. Reasoning that they would only operate in the Mediterranean Sea near the Italian Peninsula, no resources were allocated to the development of naval aviation. Despite this, the <i>Regia Marina</i> had a reputation for having well-designed ships and well-trained seamen, showing their defiance after the Battle of Taranto by heavily damaging the battleships HMS <i>Queen Elizabeth</i> and HMS <i>Valiant</i>, and fighting on against the Royal Navy — a highly experienced foe with overwhelmingly superior numerical and technological advantage — doggedly holding onto the Mediterranean for three long years until the Armistice of 1943. As the country split in two, so did the <i>Regia Marina</i>; some ships would join the Italian Co-Belligerent navy, fighting for the allies, while others would become part of the National Republican Navy of the Italian Social Republic in the north. Both of these faction's navies would fight against each other until World War II ended in 1945.</p>
						<p>The birth of the Republic of Italy in June 1946 saw the <i>Regia Marina</i> re-title itself as the <i>Marina Militare</i> (Military Navy); the following year, Italy was forced to divest nearly all of her surviving naval forces as part of the formal peace process with the victors of World War II. The threat of the Soviet Union, though, quickly pushed the western European powers and the United States into ensuring that Italy had the tools and ability to defend herself, particularly after the new republic became one of the founding members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949. As a part of the new alliance, the primary concern of the <i>Marina Militare</i> became littoral control of the Adriatic and Tyrrhenian Seas. Today, the Italian Navy operates modern vessels of nearly every type, from aircraft carriers Cavour and Giuseppe Garibaldi all the way down to diesel-powered attack submarines and coastal patrol boats.</p>

						<p>Formally organized in September 1950, the <b>People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN)</b> was initially built upon units that defected from the Republic of China Navy during the Chinese Civil War. Nominally a branch of the People's Liberation Army, their subordinate status to their ground-pounding brethren led to a variety of growing pains.</p>
						<p>Early expansion in the 1950's was primarily the result of purchasing hand-me-down frigates and destroyers from the Soviet Navy while the People's Republic of China developed shipbuilding and naval architecture skills from within its own borders (with Soviet assistance). The PLAN remained largely focused on littoral and riverine combat until the late 1980s and the break-up of the Soviet Union. China's more prominent role in world — and naval — affairs in the years hence has led to explosive growth of the modern PLAN and development of green water capabilities that continue to expand today. The PLAN operates at least one modern aircraft carrier — purchased as surplus from the Russian Federation Navy — while developing their own carrier construction program; they launched their first nuclear ballistic missile submarine in 1981, and continue to progress improvements to their own designs of surface vessels and submarines.</p><hr/>

						<p>The roots of the <b>Republic of China Navy (ROCN)</b> date back to 1912 and the establishment of the Ministry of the Navy, following the fall of the Qing Dynasty and subsequent creation of the Republic of China. The ROCN remained loyal to the Kuomintang government throughout the political chaos of the late teens and 1920's, and maintained a focus on river patrols and littoral combat, knowing it was unable to challenge the might of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) at sea.</p>
						<p>Their meager forces devastated in the opening days of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, the ROCN effectively ceased to exist again until the close of World War II. Re-constituted and bolstered by the transfer of decommissioned ships from Allied navies — and captured ships from the IJN — the ROCN was again decimated by Chinese internal politics, as some units defected to support Communist forces during the Chinese Civil War that broke out in March 1946. Loyal ROCN units were instrumental in assisting with and protecting the evacuation of over a million refugees from mainland China to the island of Taiwan in October 1949 following the defeat of Chiang Kai-shek's Chinese Nationalist forces at the hands of Mao Zedong's Communists.</p>
						<p>Much to the irritation of the People's Republic of China, Western navies — such as the United States Navy — quickly developed relations with the exiled armed forces of the Republic of China and have supported them in the decades since. Transfers of technology and materiel have kept the ROCN modern and relevant as concerns developed in the early 1990's around the PLAN's ability to potentially blockade the island. Local shipbuilding lacks the capability to deliver submarines, but has successfully built and commissioned a mix of frigates, corvettes, and local patrol vessels into ROCN service. Combined with a mix of surplus vessels purchased from the United States, France, Germany, and the Netherlands, the modern ROCN continues to pursue a mission of local littoral control and anti-blockade measures in the shadow of an expanding PLAN.</p><hr/>

						<p>Though not formally founded until shortly after the creation of the Republic of Korea on 15 August 1948, the modern <b>Republic of Korea Navy (ROKN)</b> traces its origins to the Marine Defense Group that was organized on 11 November 1945 following the Japanese withdrawal from the Korean peninsula. Originally charged with local patrols and littoral defense of Korean waters, the Marine Defense Group evolved into the Korean Coast Guard before being re-organized into the ROKN.</p>
						<p>The young navy barely had time to develop assets before finding itself embroiled in the Korean War that broke out in June 1950. Bolstered by sales and donations of surplus World War II ships and material from friendly navies — as well as the active participation of navies from the member states of the United Nations — the ROKN quickly developed a reputation of aggressiveness, competence, and effectiveness in combat. The cease-fire that ended the war three years later has given way to a long, uneasy peace between the Republic of Korea (South Korea) on the southern half of the peninsula and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) on the northern half.</p>
						<p>Since the end of the Korean War, the ROKN has concentrated its efforts on building naval forces to hold in check the Democratic People's Republic of Korea Navy (DPRKN) and their littoral naval capabilities. By the late 1970's, the growth of the South Korean economy and shipbuilding industry allowed them to grow their naval fleet with destroyers, frigates, and corvettes built indigenously. The modern ROKN continues to pursue missions of deterring aggression, protection of national maritime rights, and supporting the nation's foreign policy; as a part of their overall mission, it has engaged in several peacekeeping operations since the turn of the 21st century.</p><hr/>

						<p>Founded on 10 September 1945 — during the opening days of the Indonesian National Revoultion — the <b>Republic of Indonesia Navy (Tentara Nasional Indonesia-Angkatan Laut, or TNI–AL)</b> was initially comprised primarily of Indonesian sailors with experience serving in the Royal Dutch or Imperial Japanese navies. Initially bolstered by captured Japanese ships, they clashed with the Dutch Navy several times over the course of the conflict.</p>
						<p>The end of the revolution marked the beginning of the development of the Indonesian Navy into a modern naval force. In accordance with the results of the Round Table Conference in December 1949, the TNI-AL was transferred a variety of war equipment and naval bases. Over the next decade, the TNI-AL enhanced its strength and improved its capabilities, reorganizing itself into distinct fleet forces, founding a Marine Corps — the Naval Commando Corps Command (<i>Korps Komando-Angkatan Laut</i>, or KKO-AL) — while building a focus on naval aviation. Their access to naval combat equipment grew in scope and size, both from the Netherlands and various other countries.</p>
						<p>With their increased capabilities, the TNI-AL helped deal with a myriad of separatist movements that sprung up during the 1950s. By the height of the Cold War, a fledgling Indonesia had been largely saved from disintegrating from within and found itself embroiled in the larger conflict between the United States and Soviet Union that permeated the globe. A number of ex-Soviet Navy vessels found their way into TNI-AL service as the nation developed closer ties with the Soviets. Amidst the fallout of a September 1965 <i>coup d'état</i>, Indonesia severed ties with the Soviet Union. Several years of additional political turmoil ultimately resulted in a more democratic government that pursued closer ties with — and economic investment from — Western nations like the U.S.A. and United Kingdom.</p>
						<p>The TNI-AL undertook a significant modernization effort in the 1980s, adding missile cruisers and other advanced technology to their arsenal. Currently, Indonesia fields the largest navy of any southeast Asian nation, and is notable for its capability to build modern missile cruisers and submarines via treaties with South Korea.</p><hr/>

						<p>Following conflicts with both the British Empire and France — both of whom occupied neighboring countries — Siam began to reorganize its military in the latter portion of the 19th century. <b>The Royal Thai Navy (RTN)</b> was founded in 1875, when it was originally known as the Royal Siamese Navy. Despite royal backing, Siam was without modern warships until the conclusion of World War I, when Siamese citizens donated money for King Mongkut to purchase an R-class destroyer — HMS <i>Radiant</i> — from the Royal Navy. Re-named and commissioned into her new navy, RTNS <i>Phra Ruang</i> was the first state-of-the-art warship that saw service with the RTN.</p>
						<p>Siam later placed orders with Japanese shipyards for the construction of two coastal monitors, two submarines, and number of destroyers. These ships were involved in the 1932 <i>coup d'état</i> that transformed the absolute monarchy of Siam into the constitutional monarchy of Thailand, as well as the Franco-Thai War, which saw Thailand take advantage of the fall of France in 1940 to reclaim territory lost to the French during the conflicts of the 19th century. The conclusion of the Franco-Thai War was mediated by Japan and the treaty signed in Tokyo on 9 May 1941. Barely seven months later, Japan invaded and subjugated Thailand, forcing her government to declare war on the Allied powers in January 1942.</p>
						<p>The conclusion of World War II in the summer of 1945 brought additional political turmoil to southeast Asia; the withdrawal of the Japanese and the weakening of colonial European forces left room for many countries to undergo significant leadership changes. Backed by the Soviet Union and China, communist ideology began to expand throughout the Indochina peninsula. With the aid of the United States — and royal influence — Thailand was able to resist communist influence and join the United Nations, allowing units of the RTN to participate in both the Korean and Vietnam Wars (in cooperation with South Korea and South Vietnam, respectively).</p>
						<p>Today, the modern RTN continues to develop their overall capabilities, and is notable as the only southeast Asian nation to operate an aircraft carrier. Like their counterparts in Taiwan, local shipbuilding also has the ability to deliver modern frigates and destroyers without the need to purchase them from Western navies.</p><hr/>

						<p>Political enthusiasm for a fully fledged <b>Polish Navy</b> (<i>Marynarka Wojenna</i>) had always been tepid; a relatively short coastline and access to the Atlantic restricted by its Scandinavian neighbors led the Polish leadership to relegate what little naval assets Poland had to river and coastal defense. The first attempt at a proper navy, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Navy, achieved great success against Sweden in the Polish-Swedish War (1600-1629), but was completely destroyed by Denmark in 1637. No serious attempts at rebuilding the navy were made throughout the rest of the Commonwealth's existence, and its dissolution at the Partitions of Poland in the late 18th century meant that any hopes of doing so had all but vanished. It was Józef Piłsudski, then-Commander in Chief of the Polish Armed Forces, who founded what is now known as the modern Polish Navy on 28 November 1918, nearly three centuries after its destruction. Once again, her primary purpose was to protect the Polish coastline against various threats, with an emphasis on fast submarines, powerful destroyers, and judicious use of mines. However, the Great Depression limited the Polish Navy's major combat vessels to a mere four destroyers, five submarines, and the minelayer ORP <i>Gryf</i> at the onset of World War II.</p>
						<p>Initially deciding on a strategy of harassment and indirect engagement, Polish naval command realized that the small, mostly landlocked Baltic Sea was well within range of the Kriegsmarine and the Luftwaffe, and that any ship would be quickly found and sent to the bottom if they were to remain there. Thus on 29 August 1939, the Peking Plan was executed with assistance from the Royal Navy, evacuating the destroyers stationed in the Baltic — ORP <i>Burza</i>, ORP <i>Błyskawica</i> and ORP <i>Grom</i> — to the naval base at Leith, Scotland, just 3 days before the invasion of Poland and the outbreak of war. Initially seen as "abandoning" their country, the operation was a wise decision by the Polish naval command, preserving the destroyers to allow them to take part in the defense of Norway, Operation Dynamo, the Battle of the Atlantic, and dozens of escort and convoy missions. Moreover, supplemented by ships from the Royal Navy, the Polish Navy in exile as a whole also participated in major engagements such as the sinking of <i>Bismarck</i>, Operation Jubilee, and Operation Overlord. On the other hand, ORP Gryf and ORP Wicher, who had remained behind in the Baltic Sea, were sunk within the first three days of the war.</p>
						<p>Poland's years as a Warsaw Pact country did not diminish her need for a naval presence in the Baltic Sea, and that remained the focus of her navy for a half century following the close of World War II. Joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on 29 March 1999 forced a change in that mindset; the Polish Navy of the 21st century has re-focused on greater levels of international cooperation and sea-going patrols in cooperation with her new NATO partners, developing a specialization in sub-surface combat.</p><hr/>

						<b>Austro-Hungarian Navy</b>
						<p>Austria first gained access to the ocean in 1382, yet it would take over one hundred years for armed warships to be flying the Austrian colors starting in very small numbers in 1528. This small group mainly served as coastal defense, and was only under a very local command. It was only in 1797 that Austria truly started to maintain a navy, when Venice became a part of Austria and the Venecian fleet would become the Austrian fleet. This however only lasted for a mere 50 years before the <i>Guerre d'indipendenza italiane</i>, the Italian war for independence, broke out, in which the majority of the crews of Italian origin would turn against the Austrian rule. Having lost almost their entire Naval power, it became clear that Austrian interests on the ocean could only be secured by a proper Austrian Navy. Emperor <i>Franz Joseph</i> drew the consequences and began laying the foundation of a full Austrian Navy. With the inclusion of Hungary in 1867 the navy became the <b>Austro-Hungarian Navy</b>. Despite the everlasting budget issues, the Austro-Hungarian Navy would become one of the larger navies and would follow the latest naval trends, or even set one themselves like with the construction of the first torpedo.</p>
						<p>During the first world war the Austro-Hungarian Navy was blocked the access to the Mediterranean Sea by Italian, French and British forces, and would be delegated to a Fleet-In-Being. However the smaller forces would continuously be active in the Mediterranean, in particular submarines which would over the course of the war sink 196,000 GRT with a further 41,000 GRT being possibly sunk. On top of that numerous warships would be crippled and sunk by smaller forces. The only vessel that would see action outside the Mediterranean would be the cruiser <i>Kaiserin Elisabeth</i>, which would otherwise become known as the first target of a ship-launched aircraft.</p>
						<p>The end of the Great War in 1918 marked the end of the Austro-Hungarian empire, and as such the end of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. The remaining vessels would become parts of other navies, or in the case of Viribus Unitis get sunk by Italian divers before they could be redistributed. Austria became a nation in central Europe with no access to the ocean, rendering the need for a large navy impractical.</p><hr/>

						<p>Ships fielded by the United States Navy (USN) sport great armor (albeit in an all-or-nothing design), main battery guns, and anti-aircraft (AA) capabilities, and are less hindered by stock configurations — many were built later and subsequently underwent fewer, less drastic upgrades (unlike Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) vessels such as Kongo). Most stock American ships are adequate for their roles, and while fully-upgraded ships perform better, they require little to no change in play style. American ship-launched torpedoes are often comically bad, but the real strength of USN ships lies in their ability to get into firefights and slug it out, relying on their superior guns and survivability to see them through.</p>
						<p>The United States inherited many of its nascent naval traditions from the British, from whom they won their independence in 1776. Over the years, the fledgling American navy encountered various hurdles and successes in its conflicts with the British, French, and Spanish navies. However, a mix of poor economic outlook, isolationist sentiments and post-World War I naval disarmament treaties reduced the effectiveness and preparedness of the USN for the Second World War. All of that changed after Japan's 7 December 1941 surprise attack on Pacific Fleet headquarters at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Regarded as an underhanded sneak attack outside the rules of civilized warfare, Pearl Harbor evaporated any reluctance of the American public to go to war.</p>
						<p>With its battleship fleet crippled by the Pearl Harbor attack, the USN turned to submarines and its fledgling aircraft carrier fleet — the very weapons that the IJN had used in their attempt to neutralize the USN Pacific Fleet — and ironically put them to greater effect than the Japanese (who stuck to battleships and the "decisive battle" doctrines), achieving successes in the battles of the Coral Sea, Midway, the Philippine Sea, Leyte Gulf, and Okinawa. While slightly behind their IJN counterparts at the onset of the war, the USN gradually caught up both qualitatively and quantitatively; virtually every class of vessel was outfitted with superior fire control equipment such as radar and ballistics computers; the industrial might of the United States produced large numbers of proven designs (the 175 ships of the Fletcher class built within the space of less than four years being a prime example) with little unnecessary variation in equipment, so that crew transferred between ships could quickly fill their roles without specialized retraining. The US Navy emerged from World War II as the most powerful navy in the world, a title it still holds to this day.</p>

						<h3>Gameplay</h3>
						<p>apanese destroyers rely on remaining unspotted and depend heavily on making good use of their torpedoes; the tech tree splits at Tier V after <i>Isokaze</i>, with one line focusing on torpedoes and the other on gunnery.</p>
						<div class="shipbox box-border">
							<img alt="Ship_PJSD106_Fubuki" src="assets/image/ship_jpn/dd/Ship_PJSD106_Fubuki.png"/>  <div class="shipcaption"><i>Fubuki</i>, Tier VI destroyer</div>
						</div>
						<p>The torpedo-centric line tends to have weak, slow-turning main battery guns that are generally not worth firing unless they happen to be pointing in the enemy's direction. Even then, it is frequently better to hold fire to maintain concealment. Concealment issues are exacerbated with the Smoke Generator (While active, generates a smoke screen that blocks line-of-sight for both enemies and teammates.) on Japanese destroyers having fewer charges and shorter durations, giving captains less flexibility to get out of sticky situations. Fortunately, from Tier IX, their concealment values are above average; Tier X's <i>Shimakaze</i> has the best concealment value at her tier. Their torpedoes are unmatched at every tier, having the highest damage and longest ranges of any vessel that can equip torpedoes. This allows them to snipe enemy warships while well out of visual range. Starting with <i>Yūgumo</i> at Tier IX, their guns begin to be more effective and captains get to choose from three types of torpedoes: high-speed (up to an incredible 76 knots) but shorter range and mediocre detection range; very long range but low speed ("low" being something of a misnomer, given that they still move at more than 60 knots) and bad detection range; and an in-between option that has average speed coupled with better detection (though still more easily spotted than other nation's) and range. This allows for variable play styles and keeps opponents guessing. Combined with the Torpedo Acceleration skill the short-range torpedoes can be particularly vicious; it is almost impossible for enemy captains to dodge torpedoes streaking in at a whopping 81 knots. However, while these torpedoes have a long range and are fast, they also have the worst detectability out of all the nations.</p>
						<div class="shipbox box-border"><img alt="Ship_PJSD108_Akizuki" src="assets/image/ship_jpn/dd/Ship_PJSD108_Akizuki.png"/>  <div class="shipcaption"><i>Akizuki</i>, Tier VIII destroyer</div></div>
						<p>The gunnery-focused line does not mean that they become pseudo-American destroyers, but many of the quirks of the torpedo-focused destroyers are addressed to a certain degree, increasing the all-round capabilities of the ships while still keeping the distinctive characteristics of Japanese destroyers. However, all these improvements are implemented in an arduously gradual process — captains will only start seeing real differences once they reach <i>Shiratsuyu</i> and <i>Akizuki</i> at Tiers VII and VIII, respectively. Their turret-turning speeds are improved, their guns fire faster and further (shell damage and velocities are largely the same) and they have better anti-aircraft suites. Amazingly, until Tier VIII their concealment values are <b>better</b> than that of the torpedo-focused line, and both lines have access to the same models of torpedoes. What's more, the gunnery-focused line gets a better version of the Torpedo Reload Booster (When used, torpedo reload time is significantly reduced.) consumable! As an added bonus, starting from <i>Akizuki</i>, the destroyers mount the Japanese 100mm guns with increased HE shell penetration allowing them to penetrate 25mm armor plating naturally. When paired with the Inertia Fuse for HE Shells commander skill, these guns can penetrate up to 32mm of armor, allowing them to penetrate the bow armor and plating of most high-tier battleships and cruisers. Tier X's <i>Harugumo</i> is the epitome of the IJN gunboat destroyer, spraying copious quantities of shells in all directions. Unfortunately, these ships are equipped with fewer torpedo launchers with longer default reload times, and their mobility is among the worst for destroyers, with inferior speed, maneuverability, and underwhelming acceleration. Further compounding the maneuverability issues are their massive size and larger-than-average detection range from Tier VIII onwards. With all of these quirks, the gunnery-focused destroyers are essentially pseudo-light cruisers.</p>

						<p>Russian destroyers are an oddity; they frequently feel as if they have the powerful, fast-firing guns of their American counterparts mounted in the arduously slow-turning turrets of the Japanese destroyer line. However, that is where the similarities end; Russian destroyers excel at long- to mid-range gunnery where they can keep their enemies at an arms' length. Their guns often fire out at similar or longer ranges than their American counterparts, but have flatter firing arcs and faster shell velocities, allowing them to snipe distant targets and even citadel lightly armored cruisers (since players can reliably fire at their broadsides at medium ranges, something that American destroyers struggle with). Most of the ships in this class will reach speeds of up to 43 knots, making many of them the fastest ships in their tiers, but their maneuverability and concealment values are lackluster in comparison. Coupled with their slow turret turning speeds, Russian destroyers will struggle against the American destroyers in a close-range gunnery knife fight. Their torpedoes also leave much to be desired; the miserable effective range of 4.0 km persists until Tier VIII, and they will never exceed 10.0 km range even at top-tier; on the bright side, with fast speeds of 65-70 knots and a good number of 9 or 10 torpedo tubes on most destroyers, audacious captains can pull off spectacular ambushes or shotgun engagements (just don't forget about the minimum arming distance).</p>

						<p>German destroyers offer a mix in playstyles. A captain who enjoys Russian destroyers will enjoy the primary gun handling. Fans of Japanese destroyers will enjoy their fast-reloading torpedoes. And American destroyer captains will find themselves in one of the best capture point destroyers available. The early tiers encourage aggressive play with forward-firing torpedo arcs all the way to Tier IV. Charge an enemy battleship with Engine Boost (While active, increases a ship's speed by a fixed percentage.), change course to fire both front torpedoes, close to point-blank range, turn and unload. Unlike American destroyers, German Smoke Generator (While active, generates a smoke screen that blocks line-of-sight for both enemies and teammates.) consumables do not last as long, so they are mainly used as a defensive measure. The Tier V <i>T-22</i> loses the forward-facing torpedo arcs and serves as a transition from the low tier destroyers to the high tier. Things get interesting at Tier VI with the <i>Ernst Gaede</i>, as it adds one more tool to the German captain's arsenal: Hydroacoustic Search (While active, detects all enemy ships and torpedoes within the specified radius, without regard of obstacles such as smoke and terrain.). Now the hunted becomes the hunter, as German Destroyers from Tier VI and above are able to charge an enemy smoke cloud, activate Hydroacoustic Search (While active, detects all enemy ships and torpedoes within the specified radius, without regard of obstacles such as smoke and terrain.), and spot incoming torpedoes and the enemy ship itself. Enemy destroyers are no longer safe remaining in their smoke cloud on a capture point. Kill them or drive them off and capture the point! Hydroacoustic Search (While active, detects all enemy ships and torpedoes within the specified radius, without regard of obstacles such as smoke and terrain.) also enables German destroyers to screen ahead of the fleet and locate incoming torpedoes aimed at friendly battleships. To mix things up, both the Tier VI <i>Ernst Gaede</i> and the Tier VIII <i>Z-23</i> allow for 150mm guns. These guns, coupled with strong armor-piercing shells, enable the experienced German captain to citadel broadside cruisers. This destroyer line does have some drawbacks, however. These ships can be vulnerable to enemy aircraft spotting or attacking them. In addition, their wide hull makes it very easy for enemy cruisers and battleships to penetrate with armor-piercing shells, doing more damage than expected. A German destroyer captain must keep these weaknesses in mind when operating in a battle. Teamwork is of the utmost importance!</p>

						<p>Added in Patch 0.7.9.1, British destroyers are primarily meant to be ambushers and close-range specialists, using their excellent concealment and high acceleration to their advantage. Much like their cruiser counterparts, they can launch their torpedoes individually, greatly improving the flexibility of their salvos. Their guns are also decent, though in earlier tiers can have traversal issues. Unfortunately, they also have several major drawbacks: they don't get access to the Engine Boost consumable, their Smoke Generator duration is short in all regards (though they get multiple charges), and their anti-air is extremely weak (even for destroyers) until Tier IX. Their guns also tend to be low in caliber and have below-average ballistics, making them lose a great deal of effectiveness out of close range.</p>

						<p>French destroyers have powerful guns and great speed, but without the Smoke Generator (While active, generates a smoke screen that blocks line-of-sight for both enemies and teammates.) consumable. Except the Aigle, this tier VI destroyer is the only French destroyer with smoke.
							<ul class="noright">
								<li>To compensate for the lack of smoke, they have an unusual distribution of HP of the hull. Unlike conventional hulls, a part of the ship's HP can be reduced to zero and not take damage in those areas. This makes them more durable under fire.</li>
								<li>French Engine Boost (While active, increases a ship's speed by a fixed percentage.) consumable allow these ships to reach high velocities, making it harder to target.</li>
								<li>Starting from Tier VI, you have access to the Main Battery Reload Booster (When used, main battery reload time is significantly reduced.) consumable. This will be used most efficiently when finishing off enemy destroyers or other low health targets.</li>
								<li>Starting from Tier VIII, French destroyers boast great AP shells with a fast and flat trajectory. These shells will allow the destroyer to penetrate citadels of lightly armoured cruisers at medium ranges.</li>
							</ul>
						French destroyers generally don't have the best concealment, nor a long torpedo range, capping out at 8km from Tier VI onwards, though the speed of the torpedoes do increase. This makes them quite similar to the Russian destroyer line, performing best as gunboats. Don't contest caps too early as your high speed and poor concealment will mean that you may be spotted first and focused down. Go around the edge of the cap to spot enemy cruisers and BBs for your team. Keep shooting at targets, setting them on fire with the signature 139mm guns, sporting a high fire chance and powerful AP rounds. The high speed ( up to 54.5 knots from Le Fantasque onwards ) will allow you to get out of tough situations as soon as possible. If the enemy destroyer is spotted, simply activate the Main Battery Reload Booster (When used, main battery reload time is significantly reduced.) and take them out. Hit hard, hit fast, hit often. That is the playstyle of the French DD line.</p>

						<p>None of the various units that comprise the Pan-Asian destroyer branch originated in the countries whose flag they fly in World of Warships; every single hull was purchased from a foreign navy prior to seeing service in their respective Asian navies. As such, the line is an odd mix of play styles that dabbles in each of the other destroyer lines currently in the game: from Longjiang’s roots in the Kaiserliche Marine, to Phra Ruang’s and Gadjah Mada’s prior service in the Royal Navy, to Shenyang’s time flying the Rising Sun of the IJN, to Fushun’s Red Fleet origins, to the surplus World War II-vintage United States Navy hulls that comprise the high end of the line. Main battery performance varies widely from hull-to-hull based on the country of origin; the one unifying trait that all Pan-Asian destroyers share is that they equip deep-water torpedoes. Unlike the torpedoes mounted on other destroyers, these fish are set to run at depths of 5-6 meters, meaning that enemy destroyers cannot take hits from them; conversely, they are highly lethal to all opposing battleships and carriers, as well as most enemy cruisers. Starting with Tier VIII's Hsienyang, Pan-Asian destroyers also gain access to a modified version of the Surveillance Radar (While active, detects all enemy ships within the specified radius, disregarding obstacles such as smoke and terrain.) consumable with a shorter duration and range than that found on cruisers of similar tiers; unfortunately, they must sacrifice their Smoke Generator (While active, generates a smoke screen that blocks line-of-sight for both enemies and teammates.) in order to mount it.</p>

						<p>American cruisers are all about the guns; their primary battery, secondary battery, and anti-aircraft armament are superlative. Forgoing torpedoes after Omaha at Tier V, they are instead able to lay down an incredible hail of gunfire in almost any direction, due to the fast-firing guns located along the sides of their lower-tier ships, or in their fast-turning turrets at higher tiers. Any enemies — especially destroyers — that come within firing range and do not take evasive action are quickly sent to the bottom of the ocean, particularly after the line gains access to the Surveillance Radar (While active, detects all enemy ships within the specified radius, disregarding obstacles such as smoke and terrain.) consumable at Tier VIII. Although the Japanese often have better range and firepower, the Americans have faster turret traverse, conventional layouts, and higher rates of fire; the high shell arc of some of their cruiser rifles — like their destroyer counterparts — is a double-edged sword, with a plunging trajectory hampered by their unimpressive shell velocities. Their anti-aircraft batteries easily dissuade aircraft from venturing too close or even approaching if they're not massed together for protection; yet even then, a well-timed Defensive AA Fire (While active, the damage per second of large caliber anti-aircraft guns is increased.) will quickly deplete the assets of enemy aircraft carriers. The American cruiser line splits after Omaha into a heavy cruiser branch - starting with Pensacola and topped by Des Moines - and a light cruiser branch starting with Dallas and topped by Worcester. Des Moines is the very pinnacle of the all-gun cruiser, as she has a very powerful anti-aircraft suite and main batteries that have unrivaled rate of fire. Worcester has rapid-fire guns, many consumables, and a great AA suite, which gives her unparalleled versatility on the battlefield.</p>

						<p>Japanese cruisers tend to have fewer guns housed in slow-turning turrets, coupled with excellent maneuverability and concealment values, and virtually all of them are equipped with a complement of torpedoes that are on par with their destroyer cousins - at the higher tiers, these torpedo tubes will often be located aft of the vessel hampering firing arcs. As such, do not be fooled if a Japanese cruiser starts turning away mid-fight; they may have very likely just launched a spread of torpedoes in your direction. From Tier V's <i>Furutaka</i> onwards, they are equipped with accurate, powerful guns that, while lacking in rate of fire, have reasonable shell arcs and velocity and are able to reliably penetrate or set their enemies on fire; their high explosive shells have some of the highest chances among all cruisers in World of Warships to set targets on fire. Their anti-aircraft suites are sufficient for self-defense, but captains will be hard-pressed to protect their teammates. Tier X's <i>Zao</i> is considered the very pinnacle of what Japanese cruiser design is: difficult to detect, she strikes first and hard. She is capable of giving enemy ships a nasty surprise when they are at close range and is a highly effective surface combatant in all situations.</p>

						<p>Russian cruisers are similar to their American and German counterparts — focusing on gunnery — but are more or less the eponymous "jack of all trades" cruisers. From from Tier VI onwards, they mount largely 6-inch (152mm) guns that behave much like the fast-firing guns of the American light cruiser branch, but they have more of the Kriegsmarine's flat firing arcs and high shell velocities. Overall their anti-aircraft armament is middle-of-the road, and sufficient primarily for self-defense (with a few notable exceptions such as Tier VIII premium <i>Mikhail Kutuzov</i>). The turning radii and rudder shift of the entire line leaves much to be desired, but they do have excellent speed. With this deadly combination of speed and quick-firing, highly accurate guns, they can repeatedly pound enemies at long ranges with impunity while having the flexibility to adapt to changing conditions on the battlefield when required. However, they are generally among the largest cruisers in the game, with proportionately large citadels and lousy concealment values as a result (the Tier X <i>Moskva</i> being nearly the size of <i>Yamato</i>). They typically have rather thin armor that sometimes even destroyer guns can put a round into and penetrate. Their torpedoes are as pitiful as their destroyer counterparts, with only <i>Dmitri Donskoi</i> at Tier IX having a reasonable range of 8km and the rest of the line stuck at 4-5 km, despite sharing the same 65-knot speeds.</p>

						<p>German cruisers start off as lighter versions of their contemporaries, but as they progress up the tiers (especially past Tier VI), their true prowess is revealed: turrets that turn lightning-fast, housing guns that rapidly fire powerful armor-piercing shells at long ranges, outranging both American and Japanese cruisers and even some battleships. Moreover, they commonly have the highest health values of their tier — allowing them to take a beating before going down — and their shells have reasonable firing arcs (i.e. no rainbow-like arcs such as those found on American destroyers and light cruisers) making gunnery very comfortable. Interestingly, their torpedoes from Tier V onwards are all exactly the same; do not underestimate them, however, for while a 6.0 km range is only marginally better than mid-tier American destroyers, at 64 knots German cruiser torpedoes are the fastest torpedoes mounted by any cruiser in the game until Tier IX Japanese cruiser <i>Ibuki</i> gets her upgraded torpedo module. Mid-tier German cruisers have mediocre anti-aircraft suites at best, but at Tier VIII and above they are loaded with a mix of long-range, high damage 40mm, 55mm, and 105mm guns that provide excellent AA protection for themselves and allied ships — particularly with the Defensive AA Fire (While active, the damage per second of large caliber anti-aircraft guns is increased.) consumable — and are frequently a source of frustration for enemy carrier captains. The downside is that German cruisers overall suffer from below average to average armor, poor concealment values, sub-par HE shell damage, and rather average speed and maneuverability. Starting at Tier IV, German cruisers have access to a superior version of the Hydroacoustic Search (While active, detects all enemy ships and torpedoes within the specified radius, without regard of obstacles such as smoke and terrain.) consumable.</p>

						<h3>History</h3>
						<p>The history of Royal Navy cruisers is one of innovation and economy. Like those of competing naval powers, the Royal Navy had primarily — at the beginning of the 20th century — two basic types of cruiser: the armored cruiser and scout cruiser. Though there were many different designs reflecting the two simultaneous pressures of rapidly advancing technology and naval conservatism, nearly all would have found their place in the battle line (armored cruisers) or serving as the eyes of the fleet or with destroyers (scout cruisers).</p>
						<p>By 1907, lessons absorbed by the naval powers of the world following the Battle of Tsushima — as well as the concurrent construction and design of HMS <i>Dreadnought</i> — ensured that the end of the era of the armored cruiser was at hand. For the Royal Navy, this was a time of even greater and more rapid design experimentation. Under the leadership of Sir John Fisher, the Royal Navy was to enter a period of reform and rearmament, the consequences of which would help to shape future of British cruiser development. Because of Fisher’s energetic support for the battlecruiser theory, cruiser design in the Royal Navy began to demonstrate a preference for smaller, faster ships. Cruisers of the Royal Navy built post-HMS <i>Dreadnought</i> but before World War I were stout, well-armed, and possessed of good sea-keeping qualities when compared to their counterparts in other navies. The 152mm rifle became the standard British cruiser armament during this period.</p>
						<p>Service during World War I saw Royal Navy cruisers primarily engaged in the protection of Entente shipping, hunting German cruisers engaged in anti-shipping activities, engagements with light elements of the German fleet, and serving the traditional role of fleet scouts. Cruiser construction reached an all-time high, with over fifty produced before the end of the war in 1918; all of them of smaller, faster designs.</p>
						<p>The interwar period became one of parsimony and restriction for the Royal Navy. Heavily in debt to the United States, possessing an enormous number of ships needing disposal, and lacking the economic expansion which had driven the pre-war naval construction programs, the United Kingdom readily agreed to become a signatory party to the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. Cruiser production fell off sharply, and design priorities began to change. What would be needed now were cruisers which could be produced cheaply and possessed all-weather operational abilities, low operational cost, and high endurance. The primary armament of choice would remain the 152mm rifle, despite construction of the <i>Hawkins</i> class (which would carry 190mm rifles).</p>
						<p>The signing of the London Naval Treaty in 1930 would have far-reaching consequences for cruiser design around the world. Cruisers would now be designated as "light" or "heavy" by their armament, with light cruisers mounting 155mm or smaller rifles and heavy cruisers mounting rifles greater than 155mm to a limit of 203mm. Though the Royal Navy would evolve the <i>Hawkins</i> design — eventually fielding 203mm-armed heavy cruisers beginning with the County class — the preference would remain with the smaller, cheaper to construct and operate 133mm and 152mm-armed light cruisers. This policy would remain in effect throughout World War II, as no heavy cruisers were built after the County and <i>York</i> classes.</p>
						<p>World War II would see the cruisers of the Royal Navy come to prominence, engaging in nearly every type of mission conceivable — from naval gunfire support to convoy protection — and they would do so in every ocean of the world. Flexible and capable, British and Commonwealth cruisers would participate in nearly every action fought by their respective navies, from the defeat of <i>Admiral Graf Spee</i>, to the defense of Arctic convoys, to the protection of aircraft carrier task forces in the Pacific. Gun cruisers would remain in high service demand with the Royal Navy through the end of the war and into the post-war and Cold War years, with the last of them, the <i>Tiger</i> class, being retired in the 1970s.</p>

						<p>British cruisers in World of Warships share many similarities with American and German cruisers, with fast-firing guns housed in quick-turning turrets; however, they fire only armor-piercing rounds. While the lack of high-explosive shells greatly reduces their versatility against more heavily armored ships or well-angled opponents, their AP shells' fuse lengths and penetration values are improved over other nations' such that shots are able to penetrate in places where they would normally bounce off. In addition, they do not have another mainstay of cruisers: the Defensive AA Fire (While active, the damage per second of large caliber anti-aircraft guns is increased.) consumable. This means that Royal Navy cruisers have to brute force their way through aircraft attacks, which isn't as bad as it sounds given that their AA firepower can be on par with American cruisers (and eventually exceeds them with <i>Neptune</i> and <i>Minotaur</i>). Their armor is quite thin with rather large citadels, although like American cruisers, this weakness is partially offset by their citadels being mostly below the waterline, with exposed parts reinforced with additional armor. However, this is where the bad news ends; while having average rudder shift timings, British cruisers have extremely good acceleration values (and good top speeds) that allow them to maintain near-maximum speeds even while doing sharp turns; their concealment values are among the best for cruisers of all nations; they have additional access to other consumables like Repair Party (While active, restores a fixed percentage of a ship's hit points each second.), Surveillance Radar (While active, detects all enemy ships within the specified radius, disregarding obstacles such as smoke and terrain.), and Smoke Generator (While active, generates a smoke screen that blocks line-of-sight for both enemies and teammates.) that most other cruisers can only dream of having, giving them unparalleled utility. Their torpedo armament is sufficient for the most part — having decent ranges with 60-knot speeds – and instead of choosing between wide and narrow spreads, captains can choose to fire off individual torpedoes or expend the entire launcher at once. Skilled captains will use these cruisers' agility and tools to get themselves into advantageous positions or out of sticky situations and dictate engagements on their own terms.</p>

						<div class="shipbox box-border"><img alt="Ship_PFSC107_Algerie" src="assets/image/ship_fr/ca/Ship_PFSC107_Algerie.png"/><div class="shipcaption"><i>Algérie</i>, Tier VII cruiser</div></div>
						<p>French cruisers are very fast, enabling them to fulfill a variety of roles. They are capable of being effective destroyer hunters and cruiser killers. These cruisers are excellent fire-starters, benefitting from a high fire chance. This can be used to great effect against battleships. However, it is important to be careful because with the exception of the Tier II ship, <i>Jurien de la Gravière</i>, French cruisers below Tier VII are not well-armored. At lower tiers, it is important to preserve health and avoid extended gunfights with other cruisers and battleships.</p>
						<p>At Tier V, <i>Émile Bertin</i> has access to the Hydroacoustic Search (While active, detects all enemy ships and torpedoes within the specified radius, without regard of obstacles such as smoke and terrain.) consumable; torpedo range is also improved to 9 kilometers, which remains the same throughout subsequent tiers. At Tier VI, <i>La Galissonnière</i> and premium ship <i>De Grasse</i> are the first cruisers that have access to an upgraded version of the Engine Boost (While active, increases a ship's speed by a fixed percentage.) consumable. While active, the ship's speed is increased by 15-20%. All French cruisers that are Tier VI and above can mount the standard or premium version of this consumable. At Tier VI, these cruisers also gain access to the Defensive AA Fire (While active, the damage per second of large caliber anti-aircraft guns is increased.) consumable, which can be mounted by replacing Hydroacoustic Search. The anti-aircraft armaments of French cruisers are sub-optimal, so the use of Defensive AA Fire should be timed well to ensure that enemy aircraft squadrons cannot drop bombs and torpedoes accurately.</p>
						<p>Boasting up to 110 millimeters of armor at Tier VII, <i>Algérie</i> is the first of the French heavy cruisers. With the addition of armor, these higher tier French cruisers are able to take a hit; however, the armor should not be relied on. Proper positioning, evasive maneuvers, and use of cover are tactics that will ensure the survival of French cruisers throughout a match. At Tier X, players can look forward to <i>Henri IV</i>. This cruiser is a formidable opponent. With the Engine Boost consumable active, <i>Henri IV</i> can reach 43.9 knots, which is faster than most destroyers! <i>Henri IV</i> is a heavy hitter, sporting 240 millimeter main guns with a 12.3 second reload time. These guns have good shell arcs and velocities, allowing for long range accuracy up to the maximum range of 19.08 kilometers. If needed, <i>Henri IV</i> is capable of restoring health with access to the Repair Party (While active, restores a fixed percentage of a ship's hit points each second.) consumable.</p>

						<p>American battleships follow more orthodox and consistent designs: while their guns may not be as large and powerful as those of the IJN, the USN ships make up for it by having more guns that fire more often, giving them unmatched broadside firepower. Their anti-air suites are also fairly decent at staving off aerial assaults, although it's still recommended to have cruiser escort. In spite of inferior firing ranges and poor mobility, American battleships are capable of absorbing major damage in order to bring their guns to bear—their citadel armor is impenetrable to all but the largest caliber shells (at the cost of having a more lightly-armored bow and stern). Moving up the tech tree, their mobility progressively improves and catches up with the Japanese with the North Carolina at Tier VIII, and their AA firepower grows to the point that they either become practically immune to all but the most concentrated of air attacks, or the aircraft will not survive the return trip. From Tier III to IX, American battleships enjoy a better repair party consumable than other nations, excluding the British, giving the line better durability. The Tier X Montana is the pinnacle of the American battleship line: the evolution of the Iowa-class battleship design whose construction was cancelled some time after receiving congressional approval for construction in order to focus more on aircraft carrier production.</p>

						<p>Japanese battleships were somewhat restricted by the Washington Naval Treaty, forcing them to resort to unusual — but often innovative — designs in outfitting their battleships. This resulted in battleships that have widely varying characteristics: the ponderous and slow <i>Kawachi</i>; the fast and agile <i>Kongo</i>; and the well-balanced <i>Nagato</i>; culminating in the crown of their battleship tree, the formidable <i>Yamato</i>. Japanese battleships often have the highest caliber guns with the longest ranges of their tier, which they can extend even further still with Spotting Aircraft, allowing them to rain destruction upon their enemies with impunity. Many of them have good speeds and agility that belies their size and class, but their armor protection frequently lags behind their counterparts of other nations - it tends to be more evenly spread out around the entire ship, so while their citadels may not be as well-protected, at least until <i>Yamato</i>, they have few obvious weak spots. Like their cruiser cousins, their anti-aircraft firepower is sufficient for self-defense, but captains will want cruiser support to ward off more concentrated aerial assaults.</p>

						<p>Russian battleships are most effective at mid to close range fights as their guns become inaccurate beyond 12km. As designed to push flanks or enemy lines, the entire line boasts good health pool and turret traverse. From Tier IX and onwards, they enjoy thickly armored decks that make most HE shells shatter. They have one of the fastest traverse speed compared to the same gun caliber, making brawling easier and saving points that would've gone into Expert Marksman. The guns of this line are atypical as they get accurate at close~12km ranges but become inaccurate when shooting anything further than that, almost comparable to German battleships. Overall, the ships of this line have high citadel, making angling imperative in battleship duels. Handling of these ships may be cumbersome as they are long and from Tier VII and above, they have a huge turning radius. However, they have very good rudder-shift time that will help you avoid many obstacles if driven wisely. Russian battleships have a very peculiar consumable as they are equipped with limited Damage Control Party but with a shorter cooldown. This will help you tank more damage and survive under heavy fire.</p>

						<h3>Gameplay</h3>

						<p>German battleships exemplify their focus on designs and armor schemes capable of absorbing extraordinary amounts punishment and still remain afloat. Their main armament is often slightly smaller than their same-tier counterparts — though they reload quicker — and they frequently have more hit points and better armor, making them some of the most survivable battleships in the game. Their historical "turtleback" armor is modeled accurately in-game; they are more resilient the closer in they get to their enemies, though their armor schemes do leave them more vulnerable to long-range plunging fire. These battleships feature heavy secondary armaments up-and-down the line, further rewarding players who are able to work into close-range brawls with enemy capital ships. Like their cruiser comrades, mid-to-high tier German battleships typically feature excellent long-range anti-aircraft firepower on the backs of their 105mm dual purpose batteries, but their AA doesn't continue to scale up the closer enemy planes get like American battleship anti-aircraft firepower does. Though they feature quicker-than-average rudder shift times, they tend to have very large turning circles that make avoiding both ship and aerial torpedoes difficult. German battleships at Tier VIII and up receive access to the Hydroacoustic Search (While active, detects all enemy ships and torpedoes within the specified radius, without regard of obstacles such as smoke and terrain.) consumable to help alleviate this, but it is a constant threat that captains must keep in mind.</p>

						<p>British battleships rule the seas with grace and exemplary combat ability. These formidable ships are a serious threat to ships from every nation. At low tiers, these battleships are well-armored, making them very hard to kill with smaller caliber guns. However, they can be susceptible to large caliber AP shells. Players in British battleships should make an attempt to avoid close-range gunfights with other battleships. Excelling in medium to long range combat, these ships can burn their enemies to the waterline before they have a chance to close the range. British battleships fire some of the best high explosive shells in the game. They have a very high fire chance, which means that many salvoes will result in fires started on the decks of enemy ships. However, their withering firepower isn't limited to HE shells. If an enemy ship is foolish enough to show her broadside, British AP rounds can be a quick ticket to port. Luckily, these ships aren't limited to just gunfighting. As players progress through the line, they will find the power of the anti aircraft armament to increase with each new ship they unlock. When fully specialized for AA in higher tiers, airspace above these battleships is a no-fly zone. Another perk of Tier IX's <i>Lion</i> and Tier X's <i>Conqueror</i> is an extraordinary version of the Repair Party (While active, restores a fixed percentage of a ship's hit points each second.) consumable that makes up for their lower health pools pool compared to similar tier battleships. In certain situations, this repair is capable of restoring nearly half of the ship's total hit points. All of this means that these battleships are truly survivors who fight to their last hit point.</p>

						<p>Added in Update 0.7.2, French battleships start at low tier with traditional dreadnought-style designs, but shift to designs more akin to battlecruisers at higher tiers. They are very fast for their size, and from Tier VIII onward they get access to the Engine Boost (While active, increases a ship's speed by a fixed percentage.) consumable, further adding to their speed. Starting from Tier VI, they typically arrange their main battery guns in quadruple turrets, giving them a large volume of fire that is quite accurate and has good characteristics, though the guns themselves tend to be smaller in caliber. Their secondary guns are nothing to sneeze at either, matching or even exceeding the secondaries of those found on Japanese battleships (though still inferior to those of the Germans) and their anti-air capabilities are above-par once you get to Tier VII (though they have weak anti-air prior to that point). Unfortunately, French battleships also stick out like a sore thumb, having absolutely horrid detection values that let enemies see them coming for miles. They also tend to have sub-par armor when compared to the battleships of other nations, making it easy for their counterparts to land full damage penetrations or citadel hits. Additionally, their anti-aircraft and secondary batteries tend to be quite fragile; sustained enemy fire from high explosive shells can quickly wreck their defenses.</p>
						<p>At Tier X, players can look forward to <i>République</i>. This battleship boasts unrivaled speed in its class when making use of her Engine Boost (While active, increases a ship's speed by a fixed percentage.), has very accurate main guns that have a better rate of fire than its counterparts, excellent anti-air capabilities, and strong secondaries with excellent reach.</p>

						<h3>Gameplay</h3>
						<div class="shipbox box-border"><img alt="Ship_PASA108_Lexington" src="assets/image/ship_usa/cv/Ship_PASA108_Lexington.png"/><div class="shipcaption">USS <i>Lexington</i>, Tier VIII aircraft carrier</div></div>
						<p>Early in the war, the overall state and quantity of USN naval aviation lagged behind their Japanese rivals. Thus, their early carriers can be painful to use. Their large sizes up-and-down the line mean that they can be seen from miles away (Tier X carrier Midway has one of the worst concealment values in the game, even worse than Yamato), and even though they are quite durable with surprisingly strong anti-aircraft defenses, remaining un-spotted or sticking with teammates for protection is still recommended. All American carriers carry HE bombers with the exception of Tier VIII premium Enterprise. The HE bombs are a devastating threat to destroyers and a nuisance to other ship types. Planes have high health pool compared to their IJN counterparts, allowing them to survive longer and keep full squadrons toward the end of the game. However, torpedo bombers carry very slow torpedoes with short range and a large dispersion even when fully aimed. Players are encouraged to drop their payload at close distances. From Tier VIII and above, American attack planes can equip Tiny Tim rockets that can devastate all ship types with a single run.</p>

						<h3>Gameplay</h3>
						<div class="shipbox box-border"><img alt="Ship_PJSA012_Zuikaku_1944" src="assets/image/ship_jpn/cv/Ship_PJSA012_Zuikaku_1944.png"/><div class="shipcaption"><i>Shokaku</i>, Tier VIII aircraft carrier</div></div>
						<p>Japanese aircraft carriers have good maneuverability and concealment values, allowing them to re-position and evade enemies exceptionally well. With the exception of the Tier VIII premium <i>Kaga</i>, IJN carriers have AP bombers instead of HE. This limits their anti-destroyer role as a carrier but highly effective against German, French and Soviet battleships. Torpedo squadrons carry the best air-bourne torpedoes in the game which allow players to drop their load at safer distances from anti-air. Japanese carriers also have planes with the lowest health pools resulting in lower survivability when engaging ships with high anti-air capabilities. Poor or reckless endangerment of their squadrons will end up in the carrier running out of aircraft and thus being of limited use to the team. <i>Hakuryu</i> — or G15 <i>Taiho</i> Mod. 2 in official designation — currently represents the pinnacle of what IJN carriers might have achieved, as it can theoretically destroy even the toughest battleships with sheer squadron numbers alone.</p>

						<h3>Gameplay</h3>
						<div class="shipbox box-border"><img alt="Ship_PBSA106_Furious" src="assets/image/ship_uk/cv/Ship_PBSA106_Furious.png"/><div class="shipcaption">HMS <i>Furious</i>, Tier VI aircraft carrier</div></div>
						<p>British carriers were intoduced in update 0.8.2. Unlike other carrier lines of the Americans or Japanese, British carriers have HE bombers with the 'level bombing' feature. These are not your typical dive bombers as the planes fly horizontally over the target dropping several small bombs in the targeted area. As the bombs take time to fall, players have to time their drops wisely, taking the momentum of the target into account. British torpedo bombers are the easiest to use of all three nations. Although the damage per torpedo, speed and range are lacking; the torpedo bombers themselves have a tight turning circle and aiming guide. Multiple hits on the target will compensate for its somewhat poor stats. Attack aircraft is also something not to ignore, as they drop their payload faster than the two nations. They also arm faster, making easier for players to hit unplanned targets.</p>
